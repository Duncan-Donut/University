Mutable Vars

In regards to function calls, Core 1 simply uses pass by value, therefore when a variable is sent as a 
parameter, only the variable is sent. This means that the original variable is not modified or mutated. 
In my example, b is simply assigned to the same value of a and therefore when b is changed it does not 
affect a. This is not the case for Core 2 which sends the reference and thus b is assigned to a and 
therefore when b changes, a also changes. However Core 2 allows for both variables to reference the same
object while Advanced 1 does not. It combines both a and b into one reference and therefore when you try
to add a and b together, it does not allow it as both variables reference the same value and instead just
does nothing.
