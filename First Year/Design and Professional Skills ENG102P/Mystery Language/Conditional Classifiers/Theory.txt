Conditional Theory

I found two main differences for the Conditional Languages. When inserting 1 for the if conditional instead of true, Core 3 threw an exception. This shows that Core 3 does not interpret its booleans as a 1 for true and 0 for false like Core 1. This makes me believe that Core 3 is a strongly typed language while Core 1 and 2 are weakly typed. This belief held true for both Core 1 and Core 3 when the 1 in the if conditional was replaced with a 0 as Core 3 threw an exception and Core 1 returned false. However, with Core 2 both a 1 and 0 in the if statment resulted in True. This indicates that Core 2 does not interpret the 0 and 1 as boolean values but instead, I believe, as Integers. As 1 is also 1 and 0 is always 0, the if statement would also remain true. This also seems to be the case with Core 1 with every number except for 0.
