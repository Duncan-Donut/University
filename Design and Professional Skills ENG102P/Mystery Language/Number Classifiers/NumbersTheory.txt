Numbers' Theory

I found four main differences in the three languages provided by numbers. Core 3 was the most different and seemed the least flexible. Errors such as division by zero threw exceptions while overflows defaulted to the value of 0. Furthermore, unlike the other languages, Core 3 defaulted to Integer Division. Core 1 seemed the most flexible, being able to return infinity for division by zero and thus not stopping the program, while also being able to handle huge overflows. Core 2 was the most problematic language, while it handled division by zero with infinity, overflows that were large resulted in seemingly random values before eventually hitting infinity. This gives Core 2 a false sense of security when coding as you believe that it can handle large data accurately.
